Presented at TruffleCon 2018 in Portland Oregon

You'll need coffeescript 2.0+ to build.

The Tree builder should be replaced with a UTXO builder for better testing.

There is a bug in the Patricia Tree code.  Feel free to find it an send a pull request.

The PPTX presented at TruffleCon is in the repo.

For a remix walkthrough see the Stateless Tokens.pdf file.
